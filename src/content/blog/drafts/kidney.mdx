I donated my kidney to a stranger on October 30th.

I never really considered the possibility until I read [My Left Kidney](https://www.astralcodexten.com/p/my-left-kidney) by Scott Alexander. I reached out to Waitlist Zero on October 30th of last year. It then took about a year to complete all of the testing -- though it could've been ~4 months faster if I had been more proactive about scheduling.

Donating a kidney is a weird thing to do. Nobody I've talked to really seems to understand my motivation or reasoning though all have been supportive. It just seems like an obvious win to me. 100,000 people in the United States need a kidney. The alternative is dialysis which is time consuming (three four hour visits every week! all in a hospital! [0]), expensive, and hard on the body (which further lowers life expectancy). Receiving a kidney doesn't fix everything, but it does give the recipient another 15-20 years of life and greatly increases quality of life.

I have two kidneys. I'm perfectly healthy. I'm pretty lucky overally. Why would I _not_ donate when 100,000 others (just in the US) have such a great need?

So, I started talking to [Waitlist Zero](https://waitlistzero.org/) who put me in touch with the [National Kidney Registry (NKR)](https://www.kidneyregistry.com/). The NKR paired me with [Virginia Mason](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virginia_Mason_Medical_Center) in Seattle which [according to the NKR](https://www.kidneytransplantcenters.org/) is the best hosptial for donations in Washington state (and currently the 41th in the US).

I completed a handfull of tests at various labs and eventually made it to a full-day workup including an EKG and CT scan.
