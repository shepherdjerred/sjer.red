I donated my kidney to a stranger on October 30th of this year.

I never really considered the possibility until I read [My Left Kidney](https://www.astralcodexten.com/p/my-left-kidney) by Scott Alexander. I reached out to Waitlist Zero on October 30th of last year (I didn't realize that the dates were the same until writing this). It took about a year to complete all of the testing -- though it could've been ~6 months faster if I had been more proactive about scheduling.

Donating a kidney is a weird thing to do. Many of my friends ask me why I'm doing this. The truth is that I didn't feel I had a choice after learning it was so
