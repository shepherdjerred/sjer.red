I've been implementing a feature at work that involves asymmetric cryptography. It has been a pretty fun exercise in stitching together Go APIs while reading about best practices.

Here's a few things I've learned over the last couple of days:

- Go's cryptography [isn't FIPS compliant](https://kupczynski.info/posts/fips-golang/).
- Go has an implementation of [ECDSA](https://pkg.go.dev/crypto/ecdsa) (Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm), but it doesn't have any elliptic curve asymmetric encryption algorithms.
  - The best asymmetric algorithm that Go has is [RSA](https://pkg.go.dev/crypto/rsa)
- Go has an implementation of [PEM](https://pkg.go.dev/encoding/pem) (Privacy Enhanced Mail) data encoding which can be used to encode public/private in a familiar format. You've probably seen this format with SSH keys:
  ```
  -----BEGIN PUBLIC KEY-----
  MIIEpAIBAAKCAQEAuOuUOwNRMbqc0jMEVTOyKuVUu0bk0zD5iwIggBHpDhV58DSJ
  SK7OFIFHVMy6FKg2B3Y50srfVJ45OE9Vsb9hfErUNA/PB5meHGEI+yPKeni4GAfy
  <and so on>
  -----END PUBLIC KEY-----
  ```
- The [legacy PEM format](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc1421) has support for plaintext headers like so:

  ```
  -----BEGIN PUBLIC KEY-----
  Data: Some value I don't mind being plaintext

  MIIEpAIBAAKCAQEAuOuUOwNRMbqc0jMEVTOyKuVUu0bk0zD5iwIggBHpDhV58DSJ
  SK7OFIFHVMy6FKg2B3Y50srfVJ45OE9Vsb9hfErUNA/PB5meHGEI+yPKeni4GAfy
  <and so on>
  -----END PUBLIC KEY-----
  ```

  - The [newer RFC](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7468) eplicitly doesn't support headers, though:
    > Unlike legacy PEM encoding [RFC1421](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc1421), OpenPGP ASCII armor, and the
    > OpenSSH key file format, textual encoding does _not_ define or permit
    > headers to be encoded alongside the data.

- Go's APIs for encrypting, decrypting, signing, and verifying data are quite pleasant to use!
  - The [Go examples](https://pkg.go.dev/crypto/rsa#pkg-examples) illustrate this quite well.
- When signing data, Go will first have you run that data through a hash algorithm (e.g. [SHA256](https://pkg.go.dev/crypto/sha256)). This actually makes quite a bit of sense, and it helps me better understand why secure hashing is important for cryptography.
- OWASP (Open Worldwide Application Security Project) has a great section on [encryption algorithms](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Cryptographic_Storage_Cheat_Sheet.html#algorithms) which can help guide those less familiar with the specifics of encryption.
- There are a few algorithms for signing and encryption data with RSA. Go implements PKCS1v15 and OAEP for encryption, and PKCS1v15 and PSS for signing.
  - This [Stack Exchange answer](https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/183179/what-is-rsa-oaep-rsa-pss-in-simple-terms/183330#183330) goes into the details of these algorithms.

While I'm generally not a huge fan of Go, I do think the standard library has some nice packages, and the encryption library is definitely one of them.
