import demo from "./pokemon/demo2.mp4";

This is a half-baked post I decided to publish because it was clear I wasn't ever going to finish it. You can find the source code of this project on [GitHub](https://github.com/shepherdjerred/discord-plays-pokemon).

## Idea

Twitch Plays Pokémon, but for Discord

<figure>
  <video controls>
    <source src={demo} type="video/mp4" />

## Prior Art

- https://github.com/DrSkunk/discord-plays-pokemon (takes screenshots, no video)
- https://github.com/mabotkin/discord-plays-pokemon (sends video to a web interface, not Discord)

## Technical goals

- Low-cost to deploy on AWS.
  - It therefore shouldn't require many cores or a GPU
- Require as few dependencies on the host as possible.
- 100% automation, no manual action required.

## Challenges

- Discord doesn't have a way for bots to stream video (there are APIs for audio), so we must use a "selfbot" or a "userbot". This is against Discord's terms of service, but it's the only way forward. There are also no documented APIs for this.
  - https://github.com/discord/discord-api-docs/issues/1995#issuecomment-678550660
  - If Discord had an official API, this would've been a lot easier. I didn't want to rely on an unofficial API because it would be prone to breakage.

## Initial approach - webcam

Use a headful browser (Chrome) running Pokémon with [EmulatorJS](https://emulatorjs.org/). Stream the video of headless browser to Discord. Use the stream video as a webcam input and pipe the audio as a microphone input.

- Create a virtual display using `xvfb` and `xvfb-run`: https://github.com/shepherdjerred/discord-plays-pokemon/blob/b8b67522ca05e0dd37c740741d7a94569d372a69/Dockerfile#L21-L25
- Use `ffmpeg` and `v4l2loopback` to create a virtual webcam device with v4l2: https://github.com/shepherdjerred/discord-plays-pokemon/blob/b8b67522ca05e0dd37c740741d7a94569d372a69/load.sh#L16
- Stream emulator output to the virtual webcam using `ffmpeg`: https://github.com/shepherdjerred/discord-plays-pokemon/blob/b8b67522ca05e0dd37c740741d7a94569d372a69/src/emulator.ts#L31-L42
- Turn on camera in Discord: https://github.com/shepherdjerred/discord-plays-pokemon/blob/b8b67522ca05e0dd37c740741d7a94569d372a69/src/discord.ts#L46

This would require that the host could install kernel modules since there is a dependency on [DKMS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_Kernel_Module_Support).

### Result

I was able to get audio working, but not video.

## Pivoting - using screen share

I really wanted to get the webcam approach working because it felt relatively elegant, but I knew I could get it done quicker if I compromised. I used a real desktop environment with xvfb and no webcam. I used Discord's screen share functionality instead.

After about two hours of effort, this yielded a working albeit slow proof-of-concept. xvfb is not hardware accelerated, so everything is happenning in software. This is a problem when you are encoding video. The application worked, but it was unacceptable slow. Even the audio was significantly delayed. I tried downsizing the resolution from 1280x720 to 640x576, but it was still too slow.

## Make it fast - hardware acceleration

Next, I needed to make the application fast.

Attempting GPU acceleration with Nvidia and Chrome

Chrome didn't support Web RTC hardware acceleration on Linux, but Firefox did
