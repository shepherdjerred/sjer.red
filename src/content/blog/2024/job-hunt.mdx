I started looking for a job in June. I lost my job a couple of weeks later, which ended up being rather convenient (it's significantly easier to LeetCode while you're unemployed!). After ~2 months of studying, applying, and interviewing, I found a great spot at Pinterest, and I'm very happy to say that today is my first day.

Much has been written about how bad the current job market is for software engineers. I didn't find that to be the case, though I expect it to be much more difficult for new grads. I had an offer within ~1.5 months of seriously looking and towards the end of my search I was interviewing at several companies.

In the end, I more than doubled my compensation and Pinterest seems like an interesting place to work.

The main goal of this post is to share my experience and help others prepare to change their jobs. I was extremely lucky with my circumstances, so this advice won't directly map to anyone's experience, but hopefully it serves as a good starting point.

## tl;dr

- Look at [Tech Interview Handbook](https://www.techinterviewhandbook.org/).
- Start applying _now_, today, way before you're ready to interview.
- Track your applications using [Todoist](https://todoist.com/), a spreadsheet, whatever.
- Buy LeetCode Premium. The editorials are worth every penny.
- When LeetCoding, focus on one class of problems at a time, e.g. backtracking. Master the technique and move on to the next.
- LeetCode is a lot of work and it isn't easy. Sacrifice a 4-6 hours a day for a month so that you have a much better job during the next few years.

## Stats

Here's an overview of the positions/companies that I applied to:

![](./job-hunt/sankey.svg)

Unfortunately, it seems that I don't quality as a [great software developer](https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2006/09/06/finding-great-developers-2/). According to Joel Spolsky:

> The average great software developer will apply for, total, maybe, four jobs in their entire career.

Key:

- **Identified**: This includes every position/company that I found interesting or was contacted about
- **Backlog**: Companies that I was applying to next.
- **Skipped**: Companies that I considered, but who didn't have any open positions that met my search criteria, e.g. location or compensation.
- **Applied**: Specific positions that I applied to.
- **Rejected**: Positions that I received an explicit rejection
- **Ghosted**: Positions where the company didn't reply to me after applying, interviewing, etc.
- **Screener**: Positions where I received at least a recruiter call, online asssement, etc.
- **Interviewing**: Positions where I made it past a screener
- **Offer**: Positions that I received an offer
- **Accepted**: The only offer I said yes to (Pinterest)

I applied to a _lot_ of positions. On average, it seemed to take 2-4 weeks to hear back for a given application whether it be a rejection or not. I didn't hear back at all for nearly half of my applications.

Interviews for any given company took around a month from first reply to an offer.

## My Strategy

I started applying for jobs before I did anything else, including updating my résumé or studying/LeetCoding. I wanted the pressure of interviews so that I continued to make progress. It's much easier to put interview prep off if you don't have any interviews.

### Résumé

I don't have any special insight about résumés, and I don't even think that [my résumé](https://resume.sjer.red) is _that_ good. All I'd suggest is that you update your résumé and ask a friend, preferably someone in software, to review it.

There are paid services out there that help with résumé. Here are a couple that I know of, but can't vouch for:

- https://www.levels.fyi/services/resume

### Applying

Applications are soul-sucking. You upload your résumé and the site happily fills in the application incorrectly. I kept a text document open with things I frequently copy-paste into applications, e.g. job descriptions. I also kept track of answers I wrote for questions like "why do you want to work here", so that I could re-use answers for applications at the same company, or to tweak for other companies.

The majority of jobs that I applied for were done online. I'd search for the company and head to their careers page. I also asked for friends at companies to refer me.

Here are some places to find companies to apply to:

- My company list at the bottom of this post
- https://github.com/poteto/hiring-without-whiteboards
- https://wellfound.com/
- https://www.workatastartup.com/
  - I really can't reccommend this site. I heard responses from two companies. Both had me do an asssement or take-home project, etc. and then ghosted me. In one case, they had me record and upload a video, and then didn't even watch it (I know because Loom has a view counter).
- The monthly HN who's hiring thread
- The monthly HN who wants to be hired thread
  - I received several good leads, one of which led to an offer

### Tracking Applications

I used [Todoist](https://todoist.com/) to track my applications. It's very useful to know at a glance what you're doing and where you want to apply next. I had columns for each status I wanted to track.

I started by thinking of companies whose products I liked and added them to the backlog. Next, I would go company-by-company and apply to 3-4 open jobs, creating a new note for each job I applied to with the date of my application and a link to the opening.

I'd update the status of these notes as I received interviews, rejection emails, etc.

## Preparing for Interviews

### Data Structures/Algorithms

#### LeetCode

This is by far where I spent most of my time. Technical interviews I had ranged from being asked to implement topological sort to "how would you get out of guarded room with a gun and one bullet?".

I've struggled for years with LeetCode. I was asked very easy questions when interviewing for my AWS internship, and I received a return offer so I never _really_ had passed a LeetCode interview. My only experience with LeetCode interviews was with Google in 2018, and it did not go well (at all).

What helped this time was drastically changing how I studied. Here's what I did:

1. Buy LeetCode Premium. The editorials are how I did most of my learning. I found out that I didn't really understand many concepts like backtracking or sliding window. There are community answers, but the editorials are of much higher quality and are more consistent.
1. Start by completing easy questions. Yes, you will be asked medium/hard questions in interviews. Easy questions will help build your confidence and introduce you to core concepts. I used [this list of questions](https://leetcode.com/explore/interview/card/top-interview-questions-easy/) to start out with, though I skipped most of the "Math" and "Others".
1.

My goal was to complete 150 questions. I only [finished ~115](https://sjer.red/leetcode/), but that's still enough that I felt fairly confident going into my technical interviews at the end.
