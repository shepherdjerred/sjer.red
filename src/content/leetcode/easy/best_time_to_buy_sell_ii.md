## Problem

You are given an integer array prices where prices[i] is the price of a given stock on the ith day.

On each day, you may decide to buy and/or sell the stock. You can only hold at most one share of the stock at any time. However, you can buy it then immediately sell it on the same day.

Find and return the maximum profit you can achieve.

Example 1:

```text
Input: prices = [7,1,5,3,6,4]
Output: 7
Explanation: Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 3 (price = 5), profit = 5-1 = 4.
Then buy on day 4 (price = 3) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit = 6-3 = 3.
Total profit is 4 + 3 = 7.
```

Example 2:

```text
Input: prices = [1,2,3,4,5]
Output: 4
Explanation: Buy on day 1 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 5), profit = 5-1 = 4.
Total profit is 4.
```

Example 3:

```text
Input: prices = [7,6,4,3,1]
Output: 0
Explanation: There is no way to make a positive profit, so we never buy the stock to achieve the maximum profit of 0.
```

Constraints:

- 1 <= prices.length <= 3 \* 10^4
- 0 <= prices[i] <= 10^4

## Solution

```java
class Solution {
    public int maxProfit(int[] prices) {
        var profit = 0;

        for (int i = 0; i < prices.length - 1; i++) {
            var sellPrice = prices[i + 1];
            var buyPrice = prices[i];
            var diff = sellPrice - buyPrice;
            if (diff > 0) {
                profit += diff;
            }
        }

        return profit;
    }
}
```
