TypeScript lacks (useful) [function overloading](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_overloading). This makes sense -- TypeScript largely has zero runtime representation. Function overloading is generally done by having multiple functions with the same name and different type signature. For example, in Java:

```java
void doThing(int a) {
    System.out.println("Got an int!");
}

void doThing(String b) {
    System.out.println("Got a string!");
}

void main {
    doThing(1); // Got an int!
    doThing("1"); // Got a string!
}
```

The correct function will be called depending on the type passed in.

TypeScript is largely erased at runtime, so there isn't a way to determine which function implementation should be called. For example, consider this hypothetical syntax:

```ts
function doThing(a: number) {
  console.log("Got an number!");
}

function doThing(b: string) {
  console.log("Got a string!");
}

doThing(1);
doThing("1");
```

At runtime, do we want to call doThing(number) or doThing(string)?

JavaScript is [weakly-typed](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Data_structures#dynamic_and_weak_typing), so it can't know if you're wanting it to type coerce or not. In this example a straightforward solution would be to call the strongest match, but it becomes more complicated when you consider more complex types. For example:

```ts
type Person = {
  name: string;
  age: number;
};

type Dog = {
  name: string;
  weight: string;
};

function doThing(a: Person) {
  console.log("Got a person!");
}

function doThing(b: Dog) {
  console.log("Got a dog!");
}

doThing({
  name: "John",
  age: 21,
  weight: 140,
});
```

There aren't a reasonable set of rules to determine which function to call. So, what can we do instead?

First, it's worth mentioning that TypeScript does _kinda_ have [function overloads](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/2/functions.html#function-overloads). I haven't had a good experience using them, so I never use them.

Instead, I usually reach for [conditional types](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/2/conditional-types.html). This lets me do something that _kinda_ looks like function overloading. It allows me to write one function that handles multiple cases, and can even allow me to determine the output type based on the input.

For example:

```ts
type BoardGame = {
  name: string;
  numberOfPieces: number;
};

type VideoGame = {
  name: string;
  platform: "PC" | "Console";
};

type Game = BoardGame | VideoGame;

type BoardGamePieces<G extends Game> = G extends BoardGame ? number : undefined;

function getNumberOfPieces<G extends Game>(game: G): BoardGamePieces<G> {
  if ("numberOfPieces" in game) {
    return game.numberOfPieces as BoardGamePieces<G>;
  }
  return undefined as BoardGamePieces<G>;
}

const result1 = getNumberOfPieces({
  name: "Catan",
  numberOfPieces: 100,
});

const result2 = getNumberOfPieces({
  name: "Minecraft",
  platform: "PC",
});
```
