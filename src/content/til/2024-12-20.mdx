Recently I was working on a generic table component. I wanted to allow developers to use it for any data type. I also wanted to handle common concerns like sorting and filtering contents of the table.

This got tricky to do in a type-safe way. Not all columns should be considered sortable, so the type system would need some way to differentiate column types. Data can be sorted in many ways, so I also needed to allow the user to define how sorts should occur, and the user should define this for every sortable column. I wouldn't want to the user to forget to provide a sort function for a column that is sortable.

This is a complex problem. How do we make sure that:

- The user can pass in arbitrary rows
- The user can define columns for those rows
- The user can define which columns are sortable
- The user provides a sort function for each sortable column

My original approach was something like this:

```typescript
type Direction = "asc" | "desc";

type Sort = {
  key: string;
  direction: Direction;
};

type Column = {
  key: string;
  title: string;
  sortable?: boolean;
};

type Props = {
  rows: object[];
  columns: Column[];
  sort: Sort;
  onSort: (newSort: Sort) => void;
};

export function Table(props: Props) {
  // omitted for brevity
}
```

This would work, but it's easy to pass in the wrong types. For example:

```typescript
type Direction = "asc" | "desc";

type Sort = {
  key: string;
  direction: Direction;
};

type Column = {
  key: string;
  title: string;
  sortable?: boolean;
};

type Props = {
  rows: object[];
  columns: Column[];
  sort: Sort;
  onSort: (newSort: Sort) => void;
};

export function Table(props: Props) {
  // omitted for brevity
}

// ---cut---

const rows = [{ name: "John", birthday: "04/12/1997" }];
const columns = [
  { key: "name", title: "Name", sortable: true },
  { key: "gender", title: "Gender" },
];
const sort: Sort = {
  key: "birthday",
  direction: "asc",
};
const onSort = (sort: Sort) => {
  if (sort.key === "birthday") {
    // sort
  }
};

// pretend this is a React component and not a function call
Table({ rows, columns, onSort, sort });
```

In the above example the user added a column that doesn't exist on the data and didn't pass in a function to handle sorting names. It's really easy to make a mistake and misuse this component.

How can we make this better? Here's what I came up with:

```typescript
type Column<K extends string> = {
  key: K;
  title: string;
  sortable: boolean;
};

type Direction = "asc" | "desc";

type Sort<K extends string> = {
  key: K;
  direction: Direction;
};

// determine which columns are sortable
type Sortable<T> = Extract<T, { sortable: true }>;

type Props<R extends object, C extends Column<Extract<keyof R, string>>, SortableKey extends Sortable<C>["key"]> = {
  rows: R[];
  cols: C[];
  sort: Sort<SortableKey>;
  onSort: (newSort: Sort<SortableKey>) => void;
};

// enforce that the passed in sort's `key` allows all _sortable_ columns
function Table<R extends object, C extends Column<Extract<keyof R, string>>, SortableKey extends Sortable<C>["key"]>({
  rows,
  cols,
  sort,
  onSort,
}: Props<R, C, SortableKey>) {
  // omitted for brevity
}

const rows = [
  {
    name: "John",
    birthday: "04/12/1997",
  },
];

const cols = [
  {
    key: "name",
    title: "Name",
    sortable: false,
  },
  {
    key: "birthday",
    title: "Birthday",
    sortable: true,
  },
] satisfies Column<Extract<keyof (typeof rows)[number], string>>[];
```

Here's what it looks like in action:

```typescript
type Column<K extends string> = {
  key: K;
  title: string;
  sortable: boolean;
};

type Direction = "asc" | "desc";

type Sort<K extends string> = {
  key: K;
  direction: Direction;
};

// determine which columns are sortable
type Sortable<T> = Extract<T, { sortable: true }>;

type Props<R extends object, C extends Column<Extract<keyof R, string>>, SortableKey extends Sortable<C>["key"]> = {
  rows: R[];
  cols: C[];
  sort: Sort<SortableKey>;
  onSort: (newSort: Sort<SortableKey>) => void;
};

// enforce that the passed in sort's `key` allows all _sortable_ columns
function Table<R extends object, C extends Column<Extract<keyof R, string>>, SortableKey extends Sortable<C>["key"]>({
  rows,
  cols,
  sort,
  onSort,
}: Props<R, C, SortableKey>) {
  // omitted for brevity
}

const rows = [
  {
    name: "John",
    birthday: "04/12/1997",
  },
];

const cols = [
  {
    key: "name",
    title: "Name",
    sortable: false,
  },
  {
    key: "birthday",
    title: "Birthday",
    sortable: true,
  },
] satisfies Column<Extract<keyof (typeof rows)[number], string>>[];

// ---cut---
// this should work
Table({
  rows,
  cols,
  sort: { key: "birthday", direction: "desc" },
  onSort: (key) => {},
});

// @errors: 2322
// should not work -- trying to sort on a column that isn't sortable
Table({
  rows,
  cols,
  sort: {
    key: "name",
    direction: "desc",
  },
  onSort: (sort: Sort<"birthday">) => {
    // do sort
  },
});

// should not work -- not providing a sort function for all sortable columns
Table({
  rows,
  cols,
  sort: {
    key: "birthday",
    direction: "desc",
  },
  onSort: (sort: Sort<"name">) => {
    // do sort
  },
});

// should not work -- trying to create a column that doesn't exist on the rows
Table({
  rows,
  cols: [
    ...cols,
    {
      key: "gender",
      title: "Gender",
      sortable: false,
    },
  ],
  sort: {
    key: "birthday",
    direction: "desc",
  },
  onSort: (sort: Sort<"name">) => {
    // do sort
  },
});
```

It handles all of the cases I was concerned about. You can't pass in an invalid sorting configuration, column configuration, and the user must handle all of the sorting cases that they claim to support.

This was one of the more complex TypeScript types that I've written. I've found TypeScript to be incredibly flexible, though it requires quite a bit of time to understand how to effectively use the type system.

If you're interesting in learning more I'd highly suggest checking out [Type-Level TypeScript](https://type-level-typescript.com/) and/or [Total TypeScript](https://www.totaltypescript.com/).
