### The Storm

My Minecraft server that taught me everything I know from server administration, web development, and programming/scripting.

My surviving code is in a few places:

- <https://github.com/ShepherdJerred-minecraft>
- <https://github.com/shepherdjerred/monorepo/tree/main/ts-mc>
- <https://github.com/the-storm-mc>
- <https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/authors/riotshielder.51/>

Note that I recreated/moved a lot of these repositories so that commit history isn't correct, wiki/documentation is missing, and downloads for compiled artifact's don't exist.
