I'm a person who loves learning. I often lose hours to reading Wikipedia articles, particularly those about history.

I spend a lot of my time programming and learning more about computer science and software. I care a lot about efficiency and finding better ways to work.

I'm studying at [Georgia Tech](https://omscs.gatech.edu/) to pursue a Masters in Computer Science (OMSCS).

Aside from staring at screens, I really enjoy cooking, baking, gardening, running, and reading. Living in Seattle has turned me into a bit of a coffee snob, so I also consider that a bit of a hobby, too.

I'm very active on [GitHub](https://github.com/shepherdjerred),
so you can check that out if you're curious about what I've been working on.
My [résumé](https://resume.sjer.red/) has a more complete view of my background.

Here are a few of my favorite things:
