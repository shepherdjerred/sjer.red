C is a very confusing language.

The world is built on C, and some people are able to get _very_ good at it, but I am not one of those people.

I pick it up for class, learn it, use it, appreciate it, and then forget it. Why would I want to write an application in C? I'm not a systems programmer, so I don't touch it.

One side effect of this usage pattern is that I quickly forget how pointers and manual memory management work.

Pointers are the semantics of `calloc` and `free` are easy enough to refresh on. It takes me a little while to remember if I need to use `*`, `&`, `->`, or `.` when working with pointers. That's not a big deal though -- again, I can refresh myself on the syntax rather easily.

One thing that does trip me up (and led to a very annoying bug in a barrier algorithm) is 2D arrays, or rather representing a 2D array as a pointer.

Here's what I did.

```c
int x;
int y;
int *array;

array = calloc(x * y, sizeof(int))

for (int i = 0; i < x; i++) {
    for (int j = 0; j < y; j++>) {
        item = array[i + j];
    }
}
```

Now, this seems somewhat reasonable at first. The problem is that there is going to be a collision. `x = 0, y = 1` and `x = 1, y = 0` will refer to the same slots in the array, which shouldn't happen!

My next attempted was to change the array access to `array[i * j]`. This also doesn't work. Consider when `i = 0` or `j = 0`. Any multiplication by zero is zero, so these will all refer to the same slot.

The correct solution is rather simple. The access should be `array[(i * y) + j]`. Let's prove this with an example.

With `x = 2` and `y = 3`. These are the possible values of `i` and `j`:

```
i = 0, j = 0
i = 0, j = 1
i = 0, j = 2
i = 1, j = 0
i = 1, j = 1
i = 1, j = 2
```

Now, lets see which slot in the array each pair will fit into.

```
i = 0, j = 0; (0 * 3) + 0 = 0
i = 0, j = 1; (0 * 3) + 1 = 1
i = 0, j = 2; (0 * 3) + 2 = 2
i = 1, j = 0; (1 * 3) + 0 = 3
i = 1, j = 1; (1 * 3) + 1 = 4
i = 1, j = 2; (1 * 3) + 2 = 5
```

A unique index for each item! This is exactly what we wanted.

You should perform these accesses based on the usage patterns of your data. The example above uses the x value as the column and the y value as the row. Accesses to sequential x values will be faster than accesses to sequential y values because of locality.
